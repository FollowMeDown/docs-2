Execution Semantics
===================

.. _execution-semantics-intro:

Introduction
------------

The CasperLabs system is a decentralized computation platform. In this chapter we describe aspects of the computational model we use.


.. _execution-semantics-gas:

Measuring computational work
----------------------------

Computation is all done in a `WebAssembly (wasm) <https://webassembly.org/>`__
interpreter, allowing any programming language which compiles to wasm to become
a smart contract language for the CasperLabs blockchain. Similar to Ethereum, we use ``Gas`` to measure computational work in a way which is consistent from node to node in the CasperLabs network. Each wasm instruction is
`assigned <https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/1b382d5e5d2f8923c245c3844e4a6c372441c939/execution-engine/engine-wasm-prep/src/wasm_costs.rs#L9>`__
a ``Gas`` value, and the amount of gas spent is tracked by the runtime with each instruction executed by the interpreter. All executions are finite because each has a finite *gas limit* that specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be spent before
the computation is terminated by the runtime. How this limit is determined is discussed in more detail below.

Although computation is measured in ``Gas``, we still take payment for computation in :ref:`motes <tokens-divisibility>`. Therefore, there is a conversion rate between ``Gas`` and motes. How this conversion rate is determined is discussed elsewhere.

.. _execution-semantics-deploys:

Deploys
-------

A *deploy* represents a request from a user to perform computation on our platform. It has the following information:

-  Body: containing payment code and session code (more details on these below)
-  Header: containing

   -  the :ref:`identity key <global-state-account-key>` of the account the deploy will run in
   -  the timestamp when the deploy was created
   -  a time to live, after which the deploy is expired and cannot be included in
      a block
   -  the ``blake2b256`` hash of the body

-  Deploy hash: the ``blake2b256`` hash of the Header
-  Approvals: the set of signatures which have signed the deploy hash, these are xsused in the :ref:`account permissions model <accounts-associated-keys-weights>`

Each deploy is an atomic piece of computation in the sense that, whatever effects a deploy would have on the global state must be entirely included in a block or the entire deploy must not be included in a block.

.. _execution-semantics-phases:

Phases of deploy execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A deploy is executed in distinct *phases* in order to accommodate paying for computation in a flexible way. The phases of a deploy are payment, session, and finalization. During the payment phase, the payment code is executed. If it is successful, then the sessions code is executed during the session phase. And, finally (independent of whether session code was executed), the finalization phase is executed, which does some bookkeeping around payment. 

In particular, the finalization phase refunds the user any unspent ``Gas`` originally purchased (after converting back to motes), and moves the remaining payment into the rewards pool for the validators. The finalization phase does not include any user-defined logic, it is merely upkeep for the system.

.. _execution-semantics-payment:

Payment code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Payment code* provides the logic used to pay for the computation the deploy
will do. Payment code is allowed to include arbitrary logic, providing maximal
flexibility in how a deploy can be paid for (e.g., the simplest payment code
could use the account’s :ref:`main purse <tokens-purses-and-accounts>`, while an
enterprise application may require deploys to pay via a multi-sig application
accessing a corporate purse). We restrict the gas limit of the payment code
execution, based on the current conversion rate between gas and motes, such that
no more than ``MAX_PAYMENT_COST`` motes (a constant of the system) are spent. To
ensure payment code will pay for its own computation, we only allow accounts
with a balance in their main purse greater than or equal to ``MAX_PAYMENT_COST``,
to execute deploys.

Payment code ultimately provides its payment by performing a
:ref:`token transfer <tokens-mint-interface>` into the
`proof-of-stake contract’s payment purse <https://github.com/CasperLabs/CasperLabs/blob/1b382d5e5d2f8923c245c3844e4a6c372441c939/execution-engine/contracts/system/pos/src/lib.rs#L319>`__. If payment is not given or not enough is transferred, then payment execution is not considered successful. In this case the effects of the payment code on the
global state are reverted and the cost of the computation is covered by motes
taken from the offending account’s main purse.

.. _execution-semantics-session:

Session code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Session code* provides the main logic for the deploy. It is only executed if
the payment code is successful. The gas limit for this computation is determined
based on the amount of payment given (after subtracting the cost of the payment
code itself).

.. _execution-semantics-specifying-code:

Specifying payment code and session code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user-defined logic of a deploy can be specified in a number of ways:

-  a wasm module in binary format representing a valid
   :ref:`contract <global-state-contracts>` (Note: the named keys do not need to be
   specified because they come from the account the deploy is running in)
-  a 32-byte identifier representing the :ref:`hash <global-state-hash-key>` or
   :ref:`URef <global-state-uref>` where a contract is already stored in the global state
-  a name corresponding to a named key in the account, where a contract is stored
   under the key

Each of payment and session code are independently specified, so different
methods of specifying them may be used (e.g. payment could be specified by a
hash key, while session is explicitly provided as a wasm module).

.. _execution-semantics-deploys-as-functions:

Deploys as functions on the global state
----------------------------------------

To enable concurrent modification of :ref:`global state <global-state-head>` (either
by parallel deploys in the same block or parallel blocks on different forks of
the chain), we view each deploy as a function taking our global state as input
and producing a new global state as output. It is safe to execute two such
functions concurrently if they do not interfere with each other, which formally
can be defined to mean the functions *commute* (i.e., if they were executed
sequentially, it does not matter in what order they are executed, the final
result is the same for a given input). Whether two deploys commute is determined
based on the effects they have on the global state, i.e. which operation (read,
write, add) it does on each key in the key-value store. How this is done is
described in :ref:`Appendix C <appendix-c>`.

.. _execution-semantics-runtime:

The CasperLabs runtime
----------------------

A wasm module is not natively able to create any effects outside of reading /
writing from its own linear memory. To enable other effects (e.g. reading /
writing to the CasperLabs global state), wasm modules must import functions from
the host environment they are running in. In the case of contracts on the
CasperLabs blockchain, this host is the CasperLabs Runtime. Here, we briefly
describe the functionalities provided by imported function. All these features
are conveniently accessible via functions in the `CasperLabs rust library <https://crates.io/crates/casperlabs-contract-ffi>`__. For a more detailed
description of the functions available for contracts to import, see :ref:`Appendix A <appendix-a>`.

-  Reading / writing from global state

   -  ``read``, ``write``, ``add`` functions allow working with exiting
      :ref:`URefs <global-state-uref>`
   -  ``new_uref`` allows creating a new ``URef`` initialized with a given value (see
      section below about how ``URef``\ s are generated)
   -  ``read_local``, ``write_local``, ``add_local`` allow working with
      :ref:`local keys <global-state-local-key>`
   -  ``store_function`` allows writing a contract under a :ref:`hash key <global-state-hash-key>`
   -  ``get_uref``, ``list_known_urefs``, ``add_uref``, ``remove_uref`` allow working with
      the :ref:`named keys <global-state-contracts>` of the current context
      (account or contract)

-  Account functionality

   -  ``add_associated_key``, ``remove_associated_key``, ``update_associated_key``,
      ``set_action_threshold`` support the various
      :ref:`key management actions <accounts-key-management>`
   -  ``main_purse`` returns the :ref:`main purse <tokens-purses-and-accounts>` of
      the account

-  Runtime flow and properties

   -  ``call_contract`` allows executing a contract stored under a key (hash or
      ``URef``), including passing arguments and getting a return value
   -  ``ret`` is used by contracts to return a value to their caller (i.e. enables
      return values from ``call_contract``)
   -  ``get_arg`` allows getting arguments passed to the contract (either to session
      code as part of the deploy, or arguments to ``call_contract``)
   -  ``revert`` exits the entire executing deploy, reverting any effects it caused,
      and returns a status code that is captured in the block
   -  ``get_caller`` returns the public key of the account for the current deploy
      (can be used for control flow based on specific users of the blockchain)
   -  ``get_phase`` returns the current
      :ref:`phase <execution-semantics-phases>` of the deploy
      execution
   -  ``get_blocktime`` gets the timestamp of the block this deploy will be included
      in

-  :ref:`Mint <tokens-mints-and-purses>` functionality

   -  ``create_purse`` creates a new empty purse, returning the ``URef`` to the purse
   -  ``get_balance`` reads the balance of a purse
   -  ``transfer_to_account`` transfers from the present account’s main purse to the
      main purse of a specified account (creating the account if it does not
      exist)
   -  ``transfer_from_purse_to_account`` transfer from a specified purse to the main
      purse of a specified account (creating the account if it does not exist)
   -  ``transfer_from_purse_to_purse`` alias for the
      :ref:`mint’s transfer function <tokens-mint-interface>`

.. _execution-semantics-urefs:

Generating ``URef``\ s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``URef``\ s are generated using a `cryptographically secure random number generator <https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand_chacha/struct.ChaCha20Rng.html>`__ using the `ChaCha algorithm <https://cr.yp.to/chacha.html>`__. The random number generator is seeded by taking the ``blake2b256`` hash of the deploy hash concatenated with an index representing the current phase of execution (to prevent collisions between ``URef``\ s generated in different phases of the same deploy).

Introduction
------------

CasperLabs is a decentralized computation platform based on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Having a unit of value is required to make this system work because users must pay for computation and validators must have stake to bond. It is traditional in the blockchain space to name this unit of value “token” and we continue that tradition here.

This chapter describes how we define tokens and how they are used in our platform.

Token Generation and Distribution
---------------------------------

A blockchain system will need to have a supply of tokens available for the purposes of paying for computation and rewarding validators for the processing of transactions on the network. A great deal of effort has been taken to ensure that no single individual or entity acquires 1%+ of the tokens from the onset. The tokens will be allocated in the following fashion (subject to applicable laws and regulations):

    - 60% of total token supply will be sold to the public via validator sales and ongoing public sales.
    - 16% reserved for developer & entrepreneur incentives, advisors and community managers via a DAO structure coupled with an AWS credits style system deployed over 5 years.
    - 10% will be held by the CasperLabs network; any and all distributions will be commensurate with public release.
    - 8% reserved for the team, vesting on a schedule similar to equity incentive programs over 3 years.
    - 6% for advisors and strategic partners, distributed in a manner similar to the developer and community incentives.

In addition to the initial supply, the system will have a low rate of inflation, the results of which will be paid out to validators in the form of seigniorage, as described previously in this document.

The number of tokens used as a basis for calculating seigniorage and the above stated allocations is 10 billion.

.. _tokens-divisibility:

Divisibility of tokens
----------------------

Typically, a “token” is divisible into some number of parts. For example, Ether
is divisible into :math:`10^{18}` parts (called Wei). To avoid rounding error, it is
important to always represent token balances internally in terms of the number
of indivisible parts. For the purposes of this document we will always work in
terms of these indivisible units so as to not need to pick a particular level of
divisibility for our “token” (as this detail is not important for the present
description). We call the indivisible units which make up our token *motes*.

.. _tokens-mints-and-purses:

Mints and purses
----------------

A *mint* is a contract which has the ability to produce new motes of a
particular type. We allow for multiple mote types (each of which would have
their own mint) because we anticipate the existence of a large ecosystem of
different tokens, similar to ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. CasperLabs will deploy a
specific mint contract and it will manage the CasperLabs utility token (used for
paying for computation and bonding onto the network). The mint also maintains
all the balances for its type of mote. Each balance is associated with a
``URef``, which acts as a sort of key to instruct the mint to perform actions
on that balance (e.g., transfer motes). Informally, we will refer to these
balances as *purses* and conceptually they represent a container for motes. The
``URef`` is how a purse is referenced from outside the mint.

The ``AccessRights`` of the :ref:`URefs <global-state-urefs-permissions>`
permissions model determine what actions are allowed to be performed
when using a ``URef`` associated with a purse.

As all ``URef``\ s are unforgable, the only way to interact with
a purse is for a ``URef`` with appropriate ``AccessRights``
to be given to the current context in a valid way (see ``URef`` permissions for details).

The basic global state options map onto more standard monetary
operations according to the table below:

=================== =============================
Global State Action Monetary Action
=================== =============================
Add                 Deposit (i.e. transfer to)
Write               Withdraw (i.e. transfer from)
Read                Balance check
=================== =============================

We will use these definitions throughout this chapter as we describe the
implementation and usage of tokens on the CasperLabs system.

.. _tokens-mint-interface:

The mint contract interface
---------------------------

A valid mint contract exposes the following methods (recall that many mint
implementations may exist, each corresponding to a different “currency”).

-  ``transfer(source: URef, target: URef, amount: Motes) -> TransferResult``

   -  ``source`` must have at least ``Write`` access rights, ``target`` must have at
      least ``Add`` access rights
   -  ``TransferResult`` may be a success acknowledgement or an error in the case of
      invalid ``source`` or ``target`` or insufficient balance in the ``source`` purse

-  ``mint(amount: Motes) -> MintResult``

   -  ``MintResult`` either gives the created ``URef`` (with full access rights),
      which now has balance equal to the given ``amount``; or an error due to the
      minting of new motes not being allowed
   -  In the CasperLabs mint only the system account can call ``mint``, and it has
      no private key to produce valid cryptographic signatures, which means only
      the software itself can execute contracts in the context of the system
      account

-  ``create() -> URef``

   -  a convenience function for ``mint(0)`` which cannot fail because it is always
      allowed to create an empty purse

-  ``balance(purse: URef) -> Option<Motes>``

   -  ``purse`` must have at least ``Read`` access rights
   -  ``BalanceResult`` either returns the number of motes held by the ``purse``, or
      nothing if the ``URef`` is not valid

.. _tokens-using-purses:

Using purse ``URef``\ s
-----------------------

It is dangerous to pass a purse's ``URef`` with ``Write`` permissions to any contract. A malicious contract may use that access to take more tokens than was intended or share that ``URef`` with another contract which was not meant to have that access. Therefore, if a contract requires a purse with ``Write`` permissions, it is recommended to always use a “payment purse”, which is a purse used for that single transaction and nothing else. This ensures even if that ``URef`` becomes compromised it does not contain any more funds than the user intended on giving.

.. code:: rust

   let main_purse = contract_api::main_purse();
   let payment_purse = contract_api::create_purse();

   match contract_api::transfer_purse_to_purse(main_purse, payment_purse, payment_amount) {
       TransferResult::Success => contract_api::call_contract(contract_to_pay, payment_purse),
       _ => contract_api::revert(1),
   }

To avoid this inconvenience, it is a better practice for application developers
intending to accept payment on-chain to make a version of their own purse ``URef``
with ``Read`` access rights publicly available. This allows clients to pay via a
transfer using their own purse, without either party exposing ``Write`` access to any purse.

.. _tokens-purses-and-accounts:

Purses and accounts
-------------------

Every :ref:`accounts-head` on the CasperLabs system has a purse associated
with the CasperLabs system mint, which we call the account’s “main purse”.
However, for security reasons, the ``URef`` of the main purse is only available to code running in the context of that account (i.e. only in payment or session code). Therefore, the mint’s ``transfer`` method which accepts ``URef``\ s is not the most convenient to use when transferring between account main purses. For this reason, CasperLabs supplies a
`transfer_to_account <https://docs.rs/casperlabs-contract/latest/casperlabs_contract/contract_api/system/fn.transfer_to_account.html>`_
function which takes the public key used to derive the
:ref:`identity key <global-state-account-key>` of the account. This function uses the mint transfer function with the current account’s main purse as the ``source`` and the main purse of the account at the provided key as the ``target``. The `transfer_from_purse_to_account <https://docs.rs/casperlabs-contract/latest/casperlabs_contract/contract_api/system/fn.transfer_from_purse_to_account.html>`_ function is similar, but uses a given purse as the ``source`` instead of the present account’s main purse.

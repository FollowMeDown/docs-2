dApp
^^^^
A distributed application (dApp) is a set of `smart contracts <S.html#smart_contract>`_.

Delegation rate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Node operators (`validators <V.html#validator>`_) define a commission that they take in exchange for providing staking services. This commission is represented as a percentage of the rewards that the node operator retains for their services.

Delegator
^^^^^^^^^
Delegators are users who participate in the platform's security by delegating their tokens to validators (which adds to their weight) and collecting a part of the rewards proportional to their delegations, net of a cut ("delegation rate") that is collected by the validator.

Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^
A deployment or deploy, in short, is an **external client to node** message that includes two transactions:

#. **payment transaction** - executed to buy gas for the execution of main transaction
#. **main transaction** - the piece of software that does the actual processing changing the global state

The **external client** sends a deploy hoping that the network will execute the main transaction against the blockchain.
